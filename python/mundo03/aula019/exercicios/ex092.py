# Employee registration in Python
# Create a program that reads name, year of birth and work record booklet (number)
# then register them (with age) in a dictionary.
# If WRB is not equal to 0, the dictionary will also receive the year of contract and salary.
# Calculate and add, besides the age, how old the person will be when retires (I assume 35 years of contribution).
